  that fall outside the whitelist will be immediately rejected with a 406 "Not
  Acceptable" response.
- Defining Content-Type header mediatype whitelists; requests sending content
  bodies with Content-Type mediatypes that fall outside the whitelist will be
  immediately rejected with a 415 "Unsupported Media Type" response.
